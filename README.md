# Visualization with Seaborn

Seaborn is a visualization package that builds on top of matplotlib and pandas to provides a simple, functional, interface that is capable of generating sophisticated and beautiful visualizations. In this lecture we will provide a systematic overview of the way in which seaborn is structured, how it can be used for data exploration and to produce publication ready figures and visualizations.

# Outline

1. __Basic function structure__ - seaborn uses a simple and systematic structure for its function calls, making it easy to quickly experiment with different plot types.
2. __Axes level vs Figure level functions__ - axes level functions generate a single plot, while figure level functions have the ability to automatically produce several subplots within the same figure. We will cover how to take full advantage of both.
3. __Relationship plots__ - relationship plot are useful to plot relationships between continuous variables
4. __Categorical plots__ - categorical plots have at least one categorical feature that can be used to slice the data in various ways
5. __Using FaceGrid__ - FaceGrid is a seaborn feature that allows us to define customized plotting functions to generate each subplot of a figure while taking advantage of seaborns functionality to slice and aggregate the data
6. __Customizing seaborn with matplotlib__ - All figures generated by seaborn use matplot objects. We will learn how to access these objects and take advantage of matplotlib to further customize them.
